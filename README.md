# Smart Face Recognition Attendance System

## 📌 Project Description
The Smart Face Recognition Attendance System is an automated attendance management system that uses face recognition technology to identify individuals and mark their attendance accurately. This system reduces manual effort, prevents proxy attendance, and improves efficiency.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Automate attendance using face recognition
- Improve accuracy and reliability
- Reduce time and manual errors
- Maintain digital attendance records

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Face Recognition Library
- NumPy
- Machine Learning
- CSV / Database for attendance storage

## ⚙️ System Features
- Real-time face detection
- Face recognition using trained data
- Automatic attendance marking
- Stores date and time of attendance
- User-friendly and efficient

## 📂 Project Structure
- Design Documents
- Literature Review
- Software Requirement Specification (SRS)
- Project Synopsis
- Source Code (to be added)

## ▶️ How It Works
1. Capture face through camera
2. Compare with trained dataset
3. If match found, mark attendance
4. Store attendance details automatically
